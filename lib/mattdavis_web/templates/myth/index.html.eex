<!---
From BH:
One of the core learning styles is “imagining,” and it’s something that few people allow themselves to do enough. Imagining and fantasizing are learned skills, which can also be like muscles that atrophy. If you don’t develop these muscles, you’ll lack the creativity and excitement of pursuing crazy dreams and ideals. You’ll “grow-up” as they say and settle for reality as society and the norms around you have deemed-it.

Instead of such a bleak and uninspiring existence, you want to spend a great deal of time fantasizing about your future. You want to dream big and dream creatively. You want it to be fun and playful. Set no boundaries on your ideals and what you imagine.

Dan Sullivan:
Your future should always be bigger than your past

Big picture never been bigger
So tell me when you pull the trigga

According to psychological research, the anticipation of an event is almost always more powerful than the event itself. Both positive and negative events are generally more emotionally-charged in your head than the actual experience ends up being.

Very quickly, we adapt to our new experience and the event itself is underwhelming compared to how we imagined it to be.

Because we adapt so quickly, it’s easy to take for granted where we currently are. Moreover, because our ideals and dreams are like a horizon which is constantly moving — we never reach our ideals. The horizon always moves, no matter where you are. It’s the direction, not the destination.

If your goals are not specific and measurable, then you won’t be able to measure your progress. If you can’t clearly discern the progress you’re making:

you won’t know where you actually are
you won’t experience the joy, gratitude, and confidence of growth
if you don’t enjoy the the gratitude and confidence of growth, you won’t operate as well in the future and you won’t set bigger targets to strive for

motivation involves three components:

the value you place on your goal
your belief that specific behaviors will actually facilitate the outcomesyou desire
your belief in your own ability to successfully execute the behaviors requisite to achieving your goals

As your happiness, confidence, and hope increase, your motivation will increase. This motivation comes because you expect to achieve your goals and you highly value those goals. As you become more confidence as a person, you’ll stop setting goals that society has placed on you.

Your goals will come from inside and be uninhibited by the standards and expectations of those around you. Instead, you’ll purposefully surround yourself with better mentors, teachers, and collaborators, which will allow your dreams and ideals to expand far beyond what you could conjure-up on your own. Psychologists call this “The Transforming-Self,” and it’s the highest level of conscious evolution.

You’re constantly seeing yourself improve. You’re grateful and appreciate that progress. You spend just as much time soaking-in the Gains and you do imagining and indulging in the dreams. You then use your gains and the confidence you’ve built to get back to the playful and fantasizing process of imagining new ideals!

          <p class="left-align grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:1.8em">
            The best way to increase self-confidence is to succeed at something.
            <br /><br />
            This is your chance to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">set a challenging goal</span>, join a group committed to your success, and <span class="red-text text-darken-4">follow through on what you said</span> you would do.
            <br /><br />
            When you do this, your faith in yourself will increase and you'll be ready to do it again.
            <br /><br />
            You are about to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">cross the threshold</span> and enter the realm of trials and failures, and death and rebirth.
            <br /><br />
            You will learn to let go of the parts of yourself that are no longer serving you, and to be reborn in a new, more confident form.
