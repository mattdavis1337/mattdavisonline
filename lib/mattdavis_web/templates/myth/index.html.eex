          <p class="left-align grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:1.8em">
            There's a rumor that it only takes one month of repetition to form a new habit that will last forever. Unfortunately this is not true.
            <br /><br />
            You CAN make major changes in 30 days, but you have to do it right for it to stick.
            <br /> <br />
            In truth, you have to make a STRONG DECLARATION to yourself that things are different this time.  AND you have to fight through resistance 3-5 times and prove to yourself that you've got what it takes.
            <br /><br />
            When you first start, you'll be happy and excited about making a change for the better. You'll have the feeling of "This is Easy!".
            <br /><br />
            The hard part is when you enter the realm of <span class="red-text text-darken-3" style="font-weight:bold">Trials & Failure</span>.  Look at the Hero's Journey map.  This is where you need a HELPER. That's what this program provides.
            <br /><br />
            You've got to have a group who believes in you. Someone who reminds you what you said you wanted for yourself when you start to waver.
            <br /><br />
            At this stage it is critical that you <span class="red-text text-darken-3" style="font-weight:bold">Win 5 Battles with your Demons of Resistance</span>.  This metaphor will help you remember what to do when it is challenging.
            <br /><br />
            Whether you succeed or fail, it is important to tell your allies so they can help you. There is huge benefit in being vulnerable enough to be witnessed in both victory and defeat.

              <br /><br />
              This is where other men come in to remind you what you want.  This lesson is encoded in myth in The Odyssey.
              <br /><br />
              Odysseus ordered his crew tie him to the mast of his ship and put wax in their ears. He could hear the enrapturing call of the Sirens but he couldn't steer his ship toward them no matter how much he wanted to.
              <br /> <br />
              If it weren't for his plan, he would have SAILED HIS SHIP INTO ROCKS and killed himself and his crew. This story is a warning. You can't go as far alone as you can with a group.

              If we have to we will (consentually) tie you up and put wax in your ears if that's what it takes. You will have a CREW of ALLIES who are dedicated to seeing you win.

From BH:
One of the core learning styles is “imagining,” and it’s something that few people allow themselves to do enough. Imagining and fantasizing are learned skills, which can also be like muscles that atrophy. If you don’t develop these muscles, you’ll lack the creativity and excitement of pursuing crazy dreams and ideals. You’ll “grow-up” as they say and settle for reality as society and the norms around you have deemed-it.

Instead of such a bleak and uninspiring existence, you want to spend a great deal of time fantasizing about your future. You want to dream big and dream creatively. You want it to be fun and playful. Set no boundaries on your ideals and what you imagine.

Dan Sullivan:
Your future should always be bigger than your past

Big picture never been bigger
So tell me when you pull the trigga

According to psychological research, the anticipation of an event is almost always more powerful than the event itself. Both positive and negative events are generally more emotionally-charged in your head than the actual experience ends up being.

Very quickly, we adapt to our new experience and the event itself is underwhelming compared to how we imagined it to be.

Because we adapt so quickly, it’s easy to take for granted where we currently are. Moreover, because our ideals and dreams are like a horizon which is constantly moving — we never reach our ideals. The horizon always moves, no matter where you are. It’s the direction, not the destination.

If your goals are not specific and measurable, then you won’t be able to measure your progress. If you can’t clearly discern the progress you’re making:

you won’t know where you actually are
you won’t experience the joy, gratitude, and confidence of growth
if you don’t enjoy the the gratitude and confidence of growth, you won’t operate as well in the future and you won’t set bigger targets to strive for

motivation involves three components:

the value you place on your goal
your belief that specific behaviors will actually facilitate the outcomesyou desire
your belief in your own ability to successfully execute the behaviors requisite to achieving your goals

As your happiness, confidence, and hope increase, your motivation will increase. This motivation comes because you expect to achieve your goals and you highly value those goals. As you become more confidence as a person, you’ll stop setting goals that society has placed on you.

Your goals will come from inside and be uninhibited by the standards and expectations of those around you. Instead, you’ll purposefully surround yourself with better mentors, teachers, and collaborators, which will allow your dreams and ideals to expand far beyond what you could conjure-up on your own. Psychologists call this “The Transforming-Self,” and it’s the highest level of conscious evolution.

You’re constantly seeing yourself improve. You’re grateful and appreciate that progress. You spend just as much time soaking-in the Gains and you do imagining and indulging in the dreams. You then use your gains and the confidence you’ve built to get back to the playful and fantasizing process of imagining new ideals!

          <p class="left-align grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:1.8em">
            The only real way to increase self-confidence is to succeed at something.
            <br /><br />
            This is your chance to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">set a challenging goal</span>, join a group committed to your success, and <span class="red-text text-darken-4">follow through on what you said</span> you would do.
            <br /><br />
            When you do this, your faith in yourself will increase. Your doubts will vanish. You'll be ready to do it again.
            <br /><br />
            You are about to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">cross the threshold</span> and enter the realm of trials and failures, and death and rebirth.
            <br /><br />
            You will learn to let go of the parts of yourself that are no longer serving you, and to be reborn in a new, more confident form.

      Phase 1: THE HONEYMOON

      This phase of habit formation is characterized by the feeling of “this is easy.” As all married people will tell you, at some point even the greatest honeymoon must end. The honeymoon phase is usually the result of something inspiring. For example, a person attends a highly motivational conference, and for the first few days after the conference the individual is making positive changes in his or her life.

      Phase 2: THE FIGHT THRU

      Inspiration fades and reality sets in. A person finds himself struggling with the positive habit completion and old habits seem to be right around the corner. The key to moving to the third phase of habit formation is to win 2 or 3 “fight thru’s.” This is critical. To win the fight thru, use the following techniques:

      RECOGNIZE: Recognition is essential for winning the fight thru. When you have entered the fight through, simply say to yourself, “I have entered the fight thru, and I need to win a few to move past this.” Winning each fight thru will make it easier to win the next. Conversely, when you choose to lose a fight thru, you make it easier to lose the next one.
      ASK 2 QUESTIONS: “How will I feel if I do this?” and “How will I feel if I don’t do this?” Bring EMOTION into the equation. Let yourself feel the positive in winning the fight thru and the negative in losing.
      LIFE PROJECTION: If the above 2 techniques haven’t moved you to action, then imagine in great detail how your life will be in 5 years if you do not begin making changes. Be totally honest with yourself, and allow yourself to feel what life will be like if the changes are not made.
      Phase 3: SECOND NATURE

      Entering second nature is often described by feelings of “getting in the groove.” Once in second nature, the following are 3 common interruptions that will send a person back to the fight thru:

      THE DISCOURAGEMENT MONSTER: An individual allows negative results discourage him or her into thinking, “This isn’t working, and there is nothing I can do.”
      DISRUPTIONS: An individual experiences significant change to his or her current pattern (e.g., vacations, holidays, illness, weekends).
      SEDUCTION OF SUCCESS: An individual begins to focus on positive results and begins to think, “I’m the special one. I have finally figured out how to have great results with not so great process.”
      If a person experiences an interruption that sends him or her back to the fight thru, winning 2 or 3 fight thru’s will bring him or her back to second nature.

                <br /> <br />
                "I grew up in a prototypical masculine environment. I learned to be strong, aloof, distant, structured and independent.  I was very effective because I was very discipined and structured. Very masculine. I made a lot of money, I had a lot of nice things.  But deep down I was unhappy.
                <br /><br />
                The problem is that I had almost no access to my feelings.  I could feel anger and I could feel excitement but that was it. I didn't cry for 20 years. I barely had any relationship with my family. Relationships with women were distant, stilted and codependent. The truth was I was deeply lonely and didn't realize it.
                <br /> <br />
                I woke up one morning and I knew I couldn't continue this way. I quit my job suddenly with no backup plan. I became homeless. I traveled. I got into meditation and hypnosis. I learned to play piano and how to rap.  I started playing Authentic Relating Games. I volunteered for 3 years in Austin as an Authentic Relating facilitator. I helped hundreds of people learn to connect more deeply with each other. I learned about my own feelings and how to communicate those.
                <br /><br />
                I became a certified Circling facilitator. Circling is like relational meditation. It's relating in the moment, and learning to relate emotions to other people.  I started practicing orgasmic meditation, and have lived in a community house for the past 18 months. That means I'm constantly in connection with others. I've learned a lot about setting boundaries, entering and exiting conflict with others in a loving way, and saying what I think, and getting what I want without hurting anyone.
                <br /> <br />
                Now I'm working to balance the masculine and feminine energies within myself. I have a wonderful sexy woman in my life and we are exploring the depths of connection available in relationship.
                <br /><br /> I'm learning to set up structure and discipline in a way that feels good, so I can be more effective.  The more effective and efficient I can be, the more positive benefit I can bring to the planet. I want the world to be a place where everybody knows how to get all of their needs met and we can all give and receive in a loving way. This doesn't mean that we are always happy, but it does mean that we are always compassionate and courageous in our dealings with others.
                <br /> <br />
                I love working with men who are discovering or rediscovering the power of the masculine and feminine energies alive within them.  Balance is important!"

            Often without realizing it. We name these the <span class="red-text text-darken-4">3 Demons of Fear</span>.
            <br /><br />
            Your mentor will help you notice these thoughts
            and find the core belief behind them.
            <br /><br />
            Finally face your Demons and be free from their influence forever.
