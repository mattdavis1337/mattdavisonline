          <p class="left-align grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:1.8em">
            There's a rumor that it only takes 21 days of repetition to form a new habit that will last forever. Unfortunately that statement is fake.
            <br /><br />
            You CAN make major changes in 21 days, but you have to do it right for it to stick.
            <br /> <br />
            In truth, you have to make a STRONG DECLARATION to yourself that things are different this time.  AND you have to fight through resistance 3-5 times and prove to yourself that you've got what it takes.
            <br /><br />
            When you first start, you'll be happy and excited about making a change for the better. You'll have the feeling of "This is Easy!".
            <br /><br />
            The hard part is when you enter the realm of <span class="red-text text-darken-3" style="font-weight:bold">Trials & Failure</span>.  Look at the Hero's Journey map.  This is where you need a HELPER.  You've got to have someone who believes in you and who is going to call you on your bull if you start to go back to the old way.
            <br /><br />
            It is critical that you <span class="red-text text-darken-3" style="font-weight:bold">Win 5 Battles with your Demons of Resistance</span>.   You have to be ARMED and PUSH THROUGH resistance and win these battles. And then you need to tell your allies about your VICTORY.  We will document your victory in the archives for posterity.
            <br /><br />
            At the end, the new way feels like second nature.  You'll have the feeling of "This is Easy!" again.  But be warned! You are still not totally in the clear yet. You have to watch out for the <span class="red-text text-darken-3">Succubus of Success</span>

            Yes she's hot.  And she'll try to convince you that you're <span class="red-text text-darken-3" style="font-weight:bold">some kind of amazing rock star who doesn't have to try anymore.</span> This is dangerous and you'll go back to your old ways if you aren't careful.
            <br /><br />
            This is where other men come in.  This part is encoded in myth in The Odyssey.
            <br /><br />Odysseus had his crew tie him to the mast and put wax in their ears so he could hear the sirens but couldn't do anything about it.
            <br /> <br />
            If it weren't for his crew, he would have SAILED HIS SHIP INTO ROCKS and turned him and his crew into skeletons.

            If I have to I will literally tie you up and put wax in your ears if that's what it takes. You will have a CREW of ALLIES who are dedicated to seeing you win.

From BH:
One of the core learning styles is “imagining,” and it’s something that few people allow themselves to do enough. Imagining and fantasizing are learned skills, which can also be like muscles that atrophy. If you don’t develop these muscles, you’ll lack the creativity and excitement of pursuing crazy dreams and ideals. You’ll “grow-up” as they say and settle for reality as society and the norms around you have deemed-it.

Instead of such a bleak and uninspiring existence, you want to spend a great deal of time fantasizing about your future. You want to dream big and dream creatively. You want it to be fun and playful. Set no boundaries on your ideals and what you imagine.

Dan Sullivan:
Your future should always be bigger than your past

Big picture never been bigger
So tell me when you pull the trigga

According to psychological research, the anticipation of an event is almost always more powerful than the event itself. Both positive and negative events are generally more emotionally-charged in your head than the actual experience ends up being.

Very quickly, we adapt to our new experience and the event itself is underwhelming compared to how we imagined it to be.

Because we adapt so quickly, it’s easy to take for granted where we currently are. Moreover, because our ideals and dreams are like a horizon which is constantly moving — we never reach our ideals. The horizon always moves, no matter where you are. It’s the direction, not the destination.

If your goals are not specific and measurable, then you won’t be able to measure your progress. If you can’t clearly discern the progress you’re making:

you won’t know where you actually are
you won’t experience the joy, gratitude, and confidence of growth
if you don’t enjoy the the gratitude and confidence of growth, you won’t operate as well in the future and you won’t set bigger targets to strive for

motivation involves three components:

the value you place on your goal
your belief that specific behaviors will actually facilitate the outcomesyou desire
your belief in your own ability to successfully execute the behaviors requisite to achieving your goals

As your happiness, confidence, and hope increase, your motivation will increase. This motivation comes because you expect to achieve your goals and you highly value those goals. As you become more confidence as a person, you’ll stop setting goals that society has placed on you.

Your goals will come from inside and be uninhibited by the standards and expectations of those around you. Instead, you’ll purposefully surround yourself with better mentors, teachers, and collaborators, which will allow your dreams and ideals to expand far beyond what you could conjure-up on your own. Psychologists call this “The Transforming-Self,” and it’s the highest level of conscious evolution.

You’re constantly seeing yourself improve. You’re grateful and appreciate that progress. You spend just as much time soaking-in the Gains and you do imagining and indulging in the dreams. You then use your gains and the confidence you’ve built to get back to the playful and fantasizing process of imagining new ideals!

          <p class="left-align grey-text text-darken-2" style="font-size:1.8em">
            The only real way to increase self-confidence is to succeed at something.
            <br /><br />
            That may sound like a big claim, but if you haven't succeeded or finished anything, then your confidence is based on nothing.
            <br /><br />
            This is your chance to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">set a challenging goal</span> of your own choosing, join a group committed to your success, and <span class="red-text text-darken-4">follow through on what you said</span> you would do.
            <br /><br />
            When you do this, your faith in yourself will increase and you'll be ready to do it again.
            <br /><br />
            You are about to <span class="red-text text-darken-4">cross the threshold</span> and enter the realm of trials and failures, and death and rebirth.
            <br /><br />
            You will learn to let go of the parts of yourself that are no longer serving you, and to be reborn in a new, more confident form.

      Phase 1: THE HONEYMOON

      This phase of habit formation is characterized by the feeling of “this is easy.” As all married people will tell you, at some point even the greatest honeymoon must end. The honeymoon phase is usually the result of something inspiring. For example, a person attends a highly motivational conference, and for the first few days after the conference the individual is making positive changes in his or her life.

      Phase 2: THE FIGHT THRU

      Inspiration fades and reality sets in. A person finds himself struggling with the positive habit completion and old habits seem to be right around the corner. The key to moving to the third phase of habit formation is to win 2 or 3 “fight thru’s.” This is critical. To win the fight thru, use the following techniques:

      RECOGNIZE: Recognition is essential for winning the fight thru. When you have entered the fight through, simply say to yourself, “I have entered the fight thru, and I need to win a few to move past this.” Winning each fight thru will make it easier to win the next. Conversely, when you choose to lose a fight thru, you make it easier to lose the next one.
      ASK 2 QUESTIONS: “How will I feel if I do this?” and “How will I feel if I don’t do this?” Bring EMOTION into the equation. Let yourself feel the positive in winning the fight thru and the negative in losing.
      LIFE PROJECTION: If the above 2 techniques haven’t moved you to action, then imagine in great detail how your life will be in 5 years if you do not begin making changes. Be totally honest with yourself, and allow yourself to feel what life will be like if the changes are not made.
      Phase 3: SECOND NATURE

      Entering second nature is often described by feelings of “getting in the groove.” Once in second nature, the following are 3 common interruptions that will send a person back to the fight thru:

      THE DISCOURAGEMENT MONSTER: An individual allows negative results discourage him or her into thinking, “This isn’t working, and there is nothing I can do.”
      DISRUPTIONS: An individual experiences significant change to his or her current pattern (e.g., vacations, holidays, illness, weekends).
      SEDUCTION OF SUCCESS: An individual begins to focus on positive results and begins to think, “I’m the special one. I have finally figured out how to have great results with not so great process.”
      If a person experiences an interruption that sends him or her back to the fight thru, winning 2 or 3 fight thru’s will bring him or her back to second nature.

            Often without realizing it. We name these the <span class="red-text text-darken-4">3 Demons of Fear</span>.
            <br /><br />
            Your mentor will help you notice these thoughts
            and find the core belief behind them.
            <br /><br />
            Finally face your Demons and be free from their influence forever.
